# Creating Azure Blob

## Create a Azure Account

You can create a free Azure account by going to the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students) with the university email. This is sufficient as of now.
> **Note:** You don't have to provide any payment to sign up with Azure for students, but the account created is not a full azure account. Even with credits this account may not be qualified for all azure services which require a payment method.
